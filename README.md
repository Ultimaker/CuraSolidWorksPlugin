# CuraSolidWorksPlugin
Cura plugin to support solidworks filetypes 

## Requirements:
 * SolidWorks itself (2016, 2017 and 2018 are supported)
 * A valid licence!

## How to install via plugin browser

 1. Open Cura and open the plugin browser from the menu: (since 2.7)

 2. Look for "SolidWorks Integration" and click on install.

    NOTE: This is how it should look like, when the plugin has been correctly installed.
    
 3. Restart Cura
 
 4. Open a part file and/or assembly file of your choise. You should be able to find both file types being supported in the open file dialog:

 5. (optional) If you can't open any SolidWorks file, then you probably don't have SolidWorks installed. To be sure that the plugin is really installed, there is another double check you can make:
